        <center><p>As of the 17th of May 2024, I am actively working on two songs, one is a cover of "Human" by The Killers, the other is my own song called "Transgirl Luvin'" (its supposed to have a little emoticon heart but html doesnt like it).</p></center><br><br>

        <center><p>Here's the cover, barely worked on at all since I've been super busy, but I will focus on it soon, also need to use an actual guitar instead of that damned synth shit.</p></center><br>

        <center><p>And here is my song, TGL, I'm so excited to finish and release this one. Still needs vocals, and y'know, two more minutes of song. But for now, eat clip bitch...</p></center><br>
